# harvesting-big-data

This repository saves the works for the group project, text-mining on Apple's tweets, during the MSBA program. 

My works included applying n-gram and sentiment analysis by PySpark to explore consumers’ voices of the brand Apple. 
The findings identified market trend and buzz words of the day, along with business insights on Apple’s products. The results were also visualized by Tableau Dashboard.
